# Aldrich
Dabido's inventions with Python :D

# Set-up
1. Download the file OR copy the code on the file you want.
2. Go to the "laboratory" branch and download as zip.
> Next steps: Uncompress the file, get the folder ready for the next step.
3. Choose an IDE or run it on your own computer.
> Repl.it is a good place to start if you dont have a computer or dont want to go through a lot of setup.
> However, when using repl.it, you must go to the shell and type "python main.py"
4. Copy the files and paste 'em on the IDE or run the files on your own computer.
5. RUN ITTT!!

If you encounter any errors, contact the contributors for this github repo.

# Notes
* Each file has an ID, which is normally just a one-digit number
* If dependencies are needed for laboratory, delete the files that need the dependencies (only use this if it shoots out errors)
> For example, if sudo1 needs potion.py specifically, then delete sudo1. (only if it gives out errors)
* **For GitHub specifically:** Commits might not be renamed to certain version, so please check the commits tab on the code section.

## Laboratory Package (in-built, 0)
* The laboratory package was handmade
* Laboratory includes lists, functions and variables that can be used in every potion
* Used for utility
* Each file in the package is named "sudo" and a number ID which corresponds with the ID of each file

## Potion.py (main, 1)
* Potion.py uses the in-built "laboratory" package
* This is the main file/potion experiment
* Might be the most used file

## Loomgild.py (alt, 2)
* Loomgild.py uses the in-built "laboratory" package
* This is an alternate file and considered a side project
* Might be the second-most used file

More coming soon!
