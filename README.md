# Notes
* Each file has an ID, which is normally just a one-digit number

## Laboratory Package (in-built, 0)
* The laboratory package was handmade
* Laboratory includes lists, functions and variables that can be used in every potion
* Used for utility
* Each file in the package is named "sudo" and a number ID which corresponds with the ID of each file

## Potion.py (main, 1)
* Potion.py uses the in-built "laboratory" package
* This is the main file/potion experiment
* Might be the most used file

More coming soon!
