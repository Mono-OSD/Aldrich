# Aldrich-Potions
Dabido's inventions with Python :D

## Laboratory Package (in-built)
* The laboratory package was handmade
* Laboratory includes lists, functions and variables that can be used in every potion
* Used for utility

## Potion.py (main)
Some notes:
* Potion.py uses the in-built "laboratory" package
* This is the main file/potion experiment
* Might be the most used file

More coming soon!
